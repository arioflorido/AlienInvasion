Project 1 Notes.

1.  With Pygame handling tasks like drawing images to the screen, you can skip much of the
    tedious, difficult coding and focus on the higher-level logic of game dynamics.

2.  The screen object is called a surface. A surface in Pygame is a part of the screen where
    you display a game element. Each element in the game, like the aliens or the ship, is a
    surface. The surface returned by display.set_mode() represents the entire game window.
    When we activate the gameâ€™s animation loop, this surface is automatically redrawn on every
    pass through the loop.

3.  When you call draw() on a Group, Pygame automatically draws each element in the group
    at the position defined by its rect attribute. In this case, aliens.draw(screen) draws
    each alien in the group to the screen.

4.  In game programming, collisions happen when game elements overlap.
